# meltonweb
A single data page display for Melton Lab.  The web page is constructed using the bed2html.py script.

    bed2html.py < data/pancreatic_enhancers/*.bed > data/pancreatic_enhancers/index.html

The template for the page is embedded in the script- if you want to make changes aside from the table data, it's in there.
